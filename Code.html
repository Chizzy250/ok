        <p>Copywriting is one of highest paying {online} skill in the world. It has to do with the process of
             using copies to persuade readers into taking an action.Copywriting is a world on its own. 
             Any online skill one can think of needs copywriting skill to survive, be it affliate marketing, 
             content writing, graphics designing etc.</p>

         <p>This course albeit it has writing appended to its name,nonetheless, it doesn't wholly has 
             to do with writing.As a matter of fact, it is a skill that doesn't need one to be a guru 
             in english language before one could possibly thrive on it. It is a course that majors on 
             researching. Many who do not understand what it entails dwells on writing, which is 
             absolutely wrong. A good copywriter spends 70% on researching, then uses 30% on writing. 
             To be continued.</p>
